## About App

The TestSwiftUICompnents is a app that uses Swift UI and Combine to load the UI. It fetches data from a url and load data into a List. It loads images lazily and keeps the app as fluid as possible. On tap of a List item the user navigates to the details screen where a image or video is shown.
The app should have functionality of sharing content through mail or sms or chat messengers.
The app basically consists of two screens.

## Features

1) Codable Protocol: Codable protocol is used to convert json data fetched into swift object directly.

2) Caching Used: Images in the tableview are loaded lazily by using caching mechanism so that images dont load evrytime tableview is scrolled.

3) Swift UI: All components used will be in Swift UI, the latest framework of swift.
